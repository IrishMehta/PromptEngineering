### These are prompts that I used to create images for specific tasks for Dall E 3

**Task**: To create an image for a development project
**Prompt**: A male software engineer (20s, tech-casual attire, focused expression) actively codes at a workstation, foreground elements: 
- Hands typing on a sleek mechanical keyboard with dynamic RGB underglow illuminating the desk surface
- Curved monitor (central focus) displaying: [Textual paragraphs with bullet points]

**Midground organization**: 
- Whiteboard (left third of frame) with clean computational graphs without any text
- Wall panel (right third) with clustered square notes in #FFD700, black geometric connectors forming mind-map patterns

**Background environment**: 
- Modern office with floor-to-ceiling windows revealing nighttime cityscape (dark buildings with lit windows vs dark skies)
- Shelving with subtle tech accents on the table: miniature robot models, plant with circuit-board patterned leaves

**Art direction**: 
- Poster style with saturated colors
- Precision lighting: Cool ambient base + warm RGB accents
- Material contrast: Whiteboard vs matte black desks vs brushed metal accessories
- Depth layers: Sharp foreground focus, midground details, soft background cityscape

**Task**: To create an image for a project titled "Prompt Engineering"
*Original Prompt: An image with a simple robot  trying to understand very detailed instructions by scanning a paper which has a lot of text written in it. The frame has nothing but a futuristic robot machine (not humanoid) that scans instructions by mimicking a hand held scanner. The robot has a dark vibe to it, and the paper is white with blue inked text. The mid ground is a table where both the robot and paper are and the background is a plain white wall.*


**Optimized prompt**  

**Core Subject**:  
A futuristic non-humanoid robot (sleek matte-black metal chassis, glowing blue sensor nodes, mechanical limbs) intently scans a crumpled white paper covered in dense blue-inked text. The robot uses a built-in scanner arm emitting a thin light beam to analyze the instructions.  

**Foreground Focus**:  
- Robot’s scanner beam casting faint blue light on the paper  
- Close-up of paper text: fragmented phrases like “SYNTAX: OPTIMIZE...”, “CONTEXT: PRIORITIZE...”, “STRUCTURE: LOGICAL...”  
- Metallic claws delicately pinning the paper to a table  

**Midground**:  
- Minimalist brushed-steel workstation surface with faint circuit-board texture  
- Scattered paper scraps hinting at prior failed scans  

**Background**:  
- Stark white wall with a subtle gradient (top-to-bottom soft shadow) to imply depth  
- No decor or distractions  

**Art Direction**:  
- *Style*: Cyberpunk-infused minimalism  
- *Lighting*: Harsh overhead cool-white light contrasting with the robot’s muted blue glow  
- *Color Palette*: Monochrome (robot/table) + high-contrast accents (vivid blue text/scan beam)  
- *Depth Cues*: Sharp robot/paper details → slightly blurred midground scraps → ultra-soft background  

**Key Atmosphere**:  
A tense, clinical vibe emphasizing the robot’s struggle to decode human language – technological precision vs linguistic ambiguity.

**Prompt Engineering Techniques Applied**:  
1. **Hierarchical Detailing** (Core Subject → Foreground/Mid/Background)  
2. **Sensory Anchors** (tactile: “crumpled paper”, auditory: implied scanner hum via “glowing nodes”)  
3. **Semantic Juxtaposition** (“mechanical claws” vs “delicately pinning”)  
4. **Guided Abstraction** (legible text fragments instead of full paragraphs)  
5. **Contextual Negative Space** (empty wall reinforces isolation theme)
